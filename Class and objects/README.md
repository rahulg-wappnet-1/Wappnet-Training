# About the project
This project is about implementing class and object in Java Script.

While implementing class and object we studied about constructors, public and private , getters and setters in Java Script. 

# Constructor
A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword.

The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.

# What Happens When A Constructor Gets Called?
When a constructor gets invoked in JavaScript, the following sequence of operations take place:

A new empty object gets created.

The this keyword begins to refer to the new object and it becomes the current instance object.

The new object is then returned as the return value of the constructor.

#Access modifiers in Java Script

As we all know in Java Script everything is Public by default . 
To make any variable or function private we use '#' before the name of that variable or function (#varible_name).

# How to run 

-> node employeeobj.js
