# Abstract Class in Java Script

Actually there is no such keyword called Abstrct in Java Script.

Still to implement the abstract class we have created a class Animal this class can not instantiated but can be extended.We have also defined a function that must be implemented in all classes that exteended from this(Animal) class.

After creation new classes from parent class (Animal), these classes will inherit all the functions and properties from abstract class.
