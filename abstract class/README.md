# Abstract Class in Java Script

Abstract classes can be defined as classes that cannot be instantiated i.e. whose object reference cannot be created and contains within it, one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that can only be declared but has no implementation to it.


Actually there is no such keyword called Abstrct in Java Script.

Still to implement the abstract class we have created a class Animal this class can not instantiated but can be extended.We have also defined a function that must be implemented in all classes that exteended from this(Animal) class.

After creation new classes from parent class (Animal), these classes will inherit all the functions and properties from abstract class.
